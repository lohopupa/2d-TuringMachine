# 2D Turing Machine

This project is a visual implementation of a 2D Turing machine written in JavaScript. It allows users to interactively observe the behavior of a 2D Turing machine.

## Getting Started

To run the project, you can either open the `index.html` file in a web browser or run an HTTP server in the directory with the project files.

Alternatively, you can access the project directly [here](http://2d-turing-machine.lhpa.ru).

## Inspiration
